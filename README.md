# ESP32 AM Radio Transmitter

This is a simple project showing how to generate an AM radio transmission on 835kHz.

Audio2Header converts audio files to a c++ header.

AMTransmitterI2S plays an audio loop.
AMTransmitterI2SButton plays the audio sample on a button press.

You need an ESP32 module and a wire as antenna connected to pin 25
